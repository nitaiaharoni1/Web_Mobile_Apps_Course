a. Describe where did you use asynchronous code?:
i. in item 2, statExpress, images.js I used forEach async function to iterate all the images and create DOM elements accordingly.
ii. in item 3, calcExpress.test.js I used parallel execution of the mocha test using 'mocha.parallel' module.

b. What was easy/hard in this ex?:
i. it was difficult to understand how to work with express-session so I used my own implementation.
ii. it was each to write the express server because I am familiar with this module.
iii. Node.js is a great framework!
